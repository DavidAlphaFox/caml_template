Quick Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

If you use GODI (http://www.ocaml-programming.de/godi/), you can
install CamlTemplate from godi_console.  Otherwise, you can install
manually as described below.


Installing Manually
-------------------

Requirements:

  * Objective Caml 3.08.3 or above.
  * GNU make.

To see the configuration options, type:

./configure --help

Type:

./configure
make
make opt
make test

Then as root, type:

make install

This installs the library using ocamlfind.  Documentation is installed
in $PREFIX/doc/camltemplate.  Examples are installed in
$PREFIX/share/camltemplate/examples.

To unstall the library, type 'make uninstall' as root.

The manual contains instructions on integrating CamlTemplate with
mod_caml and mod_fastcgi.
