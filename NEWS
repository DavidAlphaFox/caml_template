    Version 1.0.2 released:

      * Removed dependency from Pcre, standart library Str used instead
        (thanks to Eric Merritt).

      * Fixed handling of --prefix switch for configure script
        (thanks to Dave Peticolas).
      
      * Moved to OCaml forge, new project page:
        http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/camltemplate/

2005-07-07
    Version 1.0.1 released:
      * Minor cleanups.

2005-05-26
    Version 1.0.0 released:

      * Fixed bug: META always depended on 'threads' even if
        threads weren't enabled.  Thread support is now compiled
        into a separate file which can be linked in if needed, instead
        of being enabled when CamlTemplate is compiled (thanks to
        Janne Hellsten).

      * Fixed incorrect interpretation of backslashes.

      * Fixed reading of template files on Cygwin (thanks to Janne
        Hellsten).

      * Fixed incorrect handling of syntax errors in macro call
        arguments.

      * Added FastCGI example.

2004-07-15
    Version 0.9.2 released:
    
      * Fixed bug that caused compile error if thread support
        was enabled.

2004-05-11
    Version 0.9.1 released:

      * Changed the line-continuation character from '#' to the
        more standard '\'.

      * Now requires OCaml 3.07.

      * Use GODI's OCamlMakefile when available.

      * Some clarifications in the manual.

2004-05-01
    Version 0.9.0 released:

      * API change: source_loader is now a class type rather than
        a virtual class.

      * Template syntax changes: whitespace preceding a statement
        is now ignored only if the whitespace starts at the
        beginning of a line.  Preceding a newline with '#' now
        causes it to be ignored.

      * Packaged for GODI.

      * 'make' targets have changed: 'make' now just builds the
        bytecode version; use 'make opt' to build the native-code
        version.  'make install' now installs documentation and
        examples.

      * Fixed incorrect linking to Unix and Pcre libraries (thanks to
        Olivier Andrieu).

      * Fixed handling of empty templates.

      * Reorganised and cleaned up source code.

2004-03-13
    Version 0.8.1 released:

      * Fixed a bug that could have caused a template to be parsed
        incorrectly if there was a syntax error in the most recently
        parsed template.

2004-02-24
    Version 0.8.0 released:

      * Added support for multiple template caches.

      * Made some cosmetic changes in the API.

      * Added a 'configure' script.

2004-02-04
    Version 0.7.2 released:

      * Added 'null' literal.

      * Fixed installation of native library (thanks to Kamil Shakirov).

      * Fixed Makefile to do a better job of finding Pcre, and to
        invoke dvips correctly on Mandrake Linux.

      * Documentation fixes.

2004-01-05
    Version 0.7.1 released:

      * Whitespace immediately preceding a statement, on the same
        line, is now ignored.

      * Fixed a bug in the handling of escape characters in
        string literals.

      * A few documentation fixes.

2004-01-03
    Version 0.7.0 released:

      * Added support for floating-point values.

      * Implemented nested scopes: macros have their own scope.
        Setting values in a template no longer changes the model.

      * Added a simple macro namespace system.  Each template
        provides a namespace for its macros; to use macros
        defined in another template, you now have to use the new
        #open statement.

      * Added a bracket operator for calculating a hash key at
        run time.

      * Added a virtual class to replace the two separate
        functions for loading and checking template source code.

      * Shortened template model type names.

      * Added some design documentation.

      * Added licence exception allowing CamlTemplate to be
        linked with Apache.

      * Several bug fixes.

2003-10-09
    Version 0.6.1 released:

      * Replaced Str with Pcre, because Str isn't thread-safe.

2003-10-08
    Version 0.6.0 released:

      * No longer requires a patch for mod_caml, because the
        patch has been included in mod_caml.

      * Added functions for escaping URLs and HTML text.

      * Bug fix: when an error occurred in a macro template, the
        name of the macro template was not reported in the
        exception message, and in some cases the line number was
        incorrect.

      * Added 'make test'.

2003-10-06
    Version 0.5.1 released (minor build and documentation fixes).
    Version 0.5.0 released.
